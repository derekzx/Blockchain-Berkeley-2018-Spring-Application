# Division to Repeating Decimal
Given two integers representing the numerator and denominator of a fraction, return the fraction in string format.
If the fractional part is repeating, enclose the repeating part in parentheses.

For example,

Given numerator = 1, denominator = 2, return "0.5".
Given numerator = -2, denominator = 1, return "-2".
Given numerator = 2, denominator = 3, return "0.(6)".
Given numerator = 5, denominator = 2, return "2.5".

## Running Tests
Run tests by opening a terminal and typing `python3 test_divide.py`.

Writing your own tests is not required but highly recommended. All that matters is you pass our internal test cases.
